          <p>St. Martin's Day once again turned Maribor's historic center into a bustling open-air festival, drawing thousands of visitors from across Slovenia and neighboring countries. Wine stands lined the streets, brass bands and DJs competed for attention, and the glow from the riverside stalls gave the city a warm and festive charm well into the night.</p>
          <p>By early evening, the banks of the Drava and the squares around the old town were packed. Glasses were raised in constant toasts, young people sang along to popular hits, and families wandered from stall to stall sampling local wines and snacks. "The atmosphere was fantastic, like every year. You could feel that people wanted to celebrate and enjoy themselves," one visitor commented while waiting in line for another glass of young wine.</p>
          <p>Yet as the night wore on, scenes of festive joy increasingly mixed with behavior that shocked local residents. Overflowing trash bins, discarded plastic cups, bottles, and food packaging began to cover the pavements. Puddles of spilled wine and beer formed sticky patches underfoot. The smell of alcohol grew stronger, but it was another stench that angered those living in the city center.</p>
          <p>"People were urinating literally every few meters," said one resident whose apartment overlooks one of the main event streets. "It started already around nine in the evening. They went between parked cars, behind kiosks, in building entrances, even under our windows. When we asked some of them to stop, they just laughed or insulted us." According to him, the situation repeated itself throughout the night despite clear signs prohibiting such behavior.</p>
          <p>Many residents blame a lack of planning as much as a lack of manners. They point out that the number of portable toilets was far from sufficient for the size of the crowd and that several units were placed in poorly lit, hard-to-find locations. Long lines formed at the available facilities, prompting some partygoers to seek "shortcuts" in nearby courtyards, alleyways, and green areas.</p>
          <p>"We are not against St. Martin's Day, not at all," the same resident stressed. "We understand it's important for tourism and the wine producers, and we like that the city is alive. But there must be some limits. Our doorways are not public toilets, and our streets should not look like a landfill the next morning." Other locals echoed the sentiment on social media, sharing photos of trash-strewn pavements and stained building facades.</p>
          <p>The morning after, the consequences of the all-night revelry were hard to overlook. Sidewalks were littered with cups, broken glass, cigarette butts, and leftover food. The smell of urine lingered in narrow streets and near residential entrances. Municipal cleaning services moved in early, using sweepers and high-pressure hoses to clear the worst of the mess before the workday began.</p>
          <p>Representatives of the city's cleaning service said their teams were on standby throughout the event and intensified work in the early hours. "We anticipated a large turnout, but this year exceeded expectations. Our crews removed several tons of waste from the city center in just a few hours," a spokesperson stated, thanking workers for their efforts but also urging visitors to act more responsibly.</p>
          <p>The city authorities have acknowledged the complaints and announced a review of event organization, including the number and distribution of toilets, clearer signage, and possible stricter enforcement against public urination and littering. Event organizers, meanwhile, emphasize that most visitors behaved properly and that large public celebrations inevitably bring challenges.</p>
          <p>Local residents insist that respect must be at the heart of future celebrations. They are calling for joint solutions: better infrastructure, visible security and patrols, and targeted awareness campaigns reminding visitors that someone lives behind every window and doorway they pass. Only with such measures, they argue, can Maribor continue to host major events without turning parts of the city center into an unpleasant and unhygienic zone.</p>
          <p>As the debate continues, one thing is clear: St. Martin's Day remains a key date on Maribor's calendar, bringing life and economic benefits to the city. The challenge now is to ensure that joy, tradition, and responsible behavior go hand in hand, so that future celebrations will be remembered for good wine and warm atmosphere rather than for trash, stench, and shameful scenes on the streets.</p>
